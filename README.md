# ToDo
- implement 'url' template tag
- Do image sorting on the frontend 
- Apply Bootstrap5.3 to the GalleryApp

# Post-MVP
- Ensure that files exist b4 sending to client
- optimize querys (in Gallery IndexView, a better should be made to get all the data needed)
- Alter (in some way) the Gallery models s.t. the model fields accurately reflect the models' relationships
- improve JS efficency: run tests to see if it is better to query the dom, or to loop over small number of elements

# Notes

- loading in scripts after all other scripts (of the base.html file) may cause conflicts 
  you may want to load in jquery on a per app basis (by default) but, you may be able to use logic to prevent scripts from loading twice
