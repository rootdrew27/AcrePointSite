# Dynamic Gallery

# ToDo
- Merge with Gallery Branch when Done
- deal with the scroll bar
- Image aspect ratio
- add more bounce to buttons 
- make script modular if possible (use functions for general tasks which may be used again)
- Add text to indicate when no results appear (also, suggest choosing a new category)


# Post-MVP
- activeCategories array could be JS object which would allow for O(1) lookup (!! verify this)
- vertically center category buttons (ie. allow for users to input a longer category name without it affecting the UI) 
- Get the carousel working for width of 280px 
- Test!
